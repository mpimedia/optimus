# Notifications Project Brief

## Business + product context

### Optimus

  * Purpose: Rails application template to kick off any new projects
  * Users: Internal Staff
  * Goal: Utilize or replace the noticed (https://github.com/excid3/noticed) gem, easy creation/subscription of notifications for a variety of actions (reporting, transactions, security alerts)

## Current notification behavior

### Future

  * Channels in use now: email
  * Channels for future: maybe sms, Slack, or Teams
  * What libraries/services we have used: ActionMailer, Noticed gem, GoodJob gem, Postmark gem (email), Twilio (sms)

## Constraints / non-negotiables

* Compliance: None
* Performance SLOs: None
* Open to continue usage of the Noticed gem if that makes things easier
* Simplicity and ease of maintenance is the key
* We are not trying to reinvent the wheel here
